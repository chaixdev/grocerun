# US-400: Shopping Execution

> *"As a user, I want an efficient way to check off items in the store so I can finish shopping quickly."*

## Goal
The "Shopping Mode" is optimized for the in-store experience: one-handed usage, clear visibility, and screen management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Shopping View**: Distinct from Planning Mode. Large text/checkboxes.
- [ ] **Wake Lock**: Screen stays on while shopping.
- [ ] **Progress**: Visual indicator of items left.
- [ ] **Completion**: Easy way to mark the trip as done.
