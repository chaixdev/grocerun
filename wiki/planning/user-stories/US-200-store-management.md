# US-200: Store Management

> *"As a user, I want to manage the stores I shop at so that I can organize my lists by aisle."*

## Goal
Allow users to define the physical context of their shopping. Stores have specific layouts (Sections) that determine the sort order of items on a list.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Store CRUD**: User can Create, Read, Update, and Delete stores.
- [ ] **Section Management**: User can define sections (e.g., "Produce", "Dairy") for a store.
- [ ] **Ordering**: User can reorder sections to match the physical path through the store.
- [ ] **Defaults**: New stores come with a sensible default set of sections.
